# Deep Learning Interview Questions for AI/ML Roles

## Neural Networks Basics

### Basic
1. **What is a neural network, and how does it relate to AI/ML roles?**  
   A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that learn patterns from data. In AI/ML, it powers tasks like image recognition, NLP, and predictive analytics by modeling complex relationships.

2. **What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?**  
   An ANN is a system of layers (input, hidden, output) that processes data through weighted connections and activation functions. In AI/ML, ANNs are used for classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., sales forecasting).

3. **What is the purpose of an activation function in a neural network?**  
   Activation functions introduce non-linearity, enabling neural networks to solve complex problems like speech recognition by transforming inputs into outputs (e.g., ReLU outputs max(0, x)).

4. **What is a loss function, and why is it important in neural networks?**  
   A loss function quantifies the difference between predicted and actual outputs (e.g., MSE for regression). It guides optimization by indicating how to adjust weights, critical for tasks like customer churn prediction.

### Intermediate
5. **Explain the difference between a perceptron and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Why might an MLP be preferred?**  
   A perceptron is a single-layer model for linearly separable data, while an MLP has multiple layers for non-linear problems. MLPs are preferred for complex tasks like image classification due to their ability to capture intricate patterns.

6. **What are weights and biases, and how do they contribute to learning?**  
   Weights determine the strength of connections between neurons, and biases shift activation functions. They are adjusted during training to minimize loss, enabling models to fit data for tasks like fraud detection.

7. **Describe backpropagation and its role in training neural networks.**  
   Backpropagation computes gradients of the loss function with respect to weights, propagating errors backward to update weights. It’s essential for optimizing models in tasks like recommendation systems.

8. **What are common optimizers like SGD, Adam, and RMSprop, and when would you use each?**  
   - **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**: Updates weights per sample, suitable for large datasets.  
   - **Adam**: Combines momentum and adaptive learning rates, versatile for most tasks.  
   - **RMSprop**: Adapts learning rates for non-stationary data, good for deep networks. In AI/ML, Adam is often default, while SGD suits fine-tuning.

### Advanced
9. **Explain the mathematical process of backpropagation, including the chain rule’s role.**  
   Backpropagation calculates gradients using the chain rule: for loss \( L \), compute \( \partial L / \partial w \) for each weight \( w \) by chaining derivatives through layers (e.g., \( \partial L / \partial w = \partial L / \partial a \cdot \partial a / \partial z \cdot \partial z / \partial w \)). This optimizes deep networks for tasks like autonomous driving.

10. **How does the choice of activation function affect training? Discuss Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh.**  
    - **Sigmoid**: Outputs [0,1], suited for binary classification but risks vanishing gradients.  
    - **ReLU**: Outputs max(0, x), accelerates training by avoiding vanishing gradients, ideal for deep networks.  
    - **Tanh**: Outputs [-1,1], centers data but may still face gradient issues. In NLP, ReLU is common for faster convergence.

11. **Why is weight initialization important, and what are common methods like Xavier and He?**  
    Proper initialization prevents vanishing/exploding gradients.  
    - **Xavier**: Scales weights for balanced gradients with Tanh/Sigmoid.  
    - **He**: Scales for ReLU to maintain variance. These ensure stable training for tasks like medical imaging.

12. **What is the vanishing gradient problem, and how can it be mitigated?**  
    Vanishing gradients occur when gradients become too small, slowing learning in deep networks. Mitigation includes:  
    - Using ReLU to avoid saturation.  
    - Batch normalization to stabilize inputs.  
    - Residual connections (e.g., ResNet). These enhance training for tasks like video analysis.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

### Basic
13. **What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and why is it effective for image data?**

    Keras is a high-level API (now part of TensorFlow) that simplifies model building with user-friendly syntax. It abstracts low-level details compared to TensorFlow’s complexity or PyTorch’s dynamic graphs, speeding up prototyping for tasks like sentiment analysis.

### Advanced
20. **How does dropout regularize CNNs, and what is its impact on performance?**  
    Dropout randomly deactivates neurons during training (e.g., 50% probability), preventing co-adaptation and reducing overfitting. It improves generalization for tasks like anomaly detection, though it may slow training.

21. **What is batch normalization, and how does it enhance training?**  
    Batch normalization normalizes layer inputs (mean=0, variance=1) per mini-batch, stabilizing gradients and speeding up convergence. It’s vital for deep networks in tasks like speech recognition.

22. **Compare LeNet, AlexNet, and VGG architectures. What are their key features and use cases?**  
    - **LeNet**: Early CNN for digit recognition; simple with conv+pool layers.

24. **What are L1 and L2 regularization, and when would you use each in CNNs?**  
    - **L1**: Adds absolute weight penalties, promoting sparsity (fewer non-zero weights), useful for feature selection.  
    - **L2**: Adds squared weight penalties, shrinking weights evenly, preventing overfitting. In CNNs, L2 is common for tasks like medical diagnostics, while L1 aids interpretability.

## Data Preparation

    Preprocessing ensures data quality (e.g., scaling, cleaning), reducing noise and enabling robust models for tasks like predictive maintenance or customer segmentation.

26. **What is data augmentation, and why is it used in deep learning?**  
    Data augmentation applies transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping) to increase dataset diversity, improving model generalization for tasks like autonomous driving.

27. **What is normalization in image processing, and why is it necessary?**  
    Normalization scales pixel values (e.g., [0, 255] to [0, 1]), ensuring consistent input ranges and faster convergence for tasks like satellite imagery analysis.

### Intermediate
28. **Explain tokenization in NLP and its importance for text data.**  
    Tokenization splits text into units (e.g., words, subwords), converting it to numerical inputs. It’s essential for tasks like chatbots or sentiment analysis, enabling models to process language.

29. **What are word embeddings, and how do they benefit deep learning models?**  
    Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) map words to dense vectors capturing semantic relationships. They enhance performance in tasks like machine translation by preserving meaning.

    - **Class Weighting**: Increase loss for minority class.  
    - **Data Augmentation**: Generate synthetic minority samples. These ensure fairness in tasks like fraud detection.

32. **What is padding in sequence data, and why is it necessary for deep learning models?**  
    Padding adds tokens (e.g., zeros) to ensure uniform sequence lengths for batch processing. It’s critical for tasks like text classification or time-series forecasting with RNNs.

33. **How does grayscale conversion impact CNN performance for image tasks?**  
    Grayscale conversion reduces images to one channel, lowering computation but potentially losing color information. It suits tasks like edge detection but may harm performance in color-sensitive tasks like art style classification.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Basic

36. **What is the role of batch size in training neural networks?**  
    Batch size determines samples processed per iteration:  
    - Large: Faster, smoother gradients.  
    - Small: Noisier, better generalization. It balances speed and accuracy in tasks like video analysis.

### Advanced
37. **How do you decide the number of layers and neurons in a neural network?**  
    - **Layers**: Deeper networks capture complex patterns but risk overfitting; start small, increase for complex tasks (e.g., speech synthesis).  
    - **Neurons**: Wider layers model more features; adjust based on data size and task (e.g., NLP vs. vision). Use validation performance to guide choices.

38. **What is the dropout rate, and how does it prevent overfitting?**  
    Dropout rate (e.g., 0.5) specifies the fraction of neurons deactivated per iteration, reducing reliance on specific neurons. It enhances generalization for tasks like predictive analytics.
